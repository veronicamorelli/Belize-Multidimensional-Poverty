# Belize-Multidimensional-Poverty

This project explores poverty in Belize through a multidimensional perspective, challenging conventional measurement approaches. Traditionally, poverty is assessed using composed indicators, but such methods often fall short in capturing the complexity of social structures. We adopt the Oxford Poverty and Hu- man Development Initiative (OPHI) methodology, based on Alkire and Foster’s framework, which, while widely used, has limitations in representing societal complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce a different approach based non-aggregative algorithms, particularly Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). This approach allows for a more detailed and dynamic understanding of poverty in Belize, moving beyond tradi- tional aggregation constraints. The research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of the Alkire and Foster methodology in capturing the intricate dimensions of poverty and how SOMs can enhance the analysis. Beyond academic insights, the practical implications of our study are significant. By shedding light on Belize’s poverty landscape, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of poverty’s dimensions. Our ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for the Belize government, empowering them to develop tar- geted strategies. Despite limitations related to binary data and the unavailability of social-demographic and economic information, our study strives to refine poverty analysis in Belize and offer methodologies with broader implications for global multidimensional poverty research.
